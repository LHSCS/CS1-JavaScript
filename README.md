# Computer Science 1
**Instructor:** Jeff Seely

Our digital world is full of computers. You find them not only on your desktop, but in smart phones, cars and drones. 
If you are interested in learning how to program these digital devices to do what you want, Computer Science 1 is a great 
place to start. In this course you will learn JavaScript, a language used all over the internet, but also used to develop 
video games and to control robots. You will learn how to write programs and simple games that your friends can try out on 
the internet and get a chance to build and program a small self-driving vehicle, all with JavaScript. Additional topics are 
covered in Computer Science 2. But  this is the change I want.
