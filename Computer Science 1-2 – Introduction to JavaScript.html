While calculating machines became common in the early 1900’s, they were called adding machines or comptometers, not computers, and the definition of a computer being a person held until the after World War II when electronic computers became more common. In our time, <em>computers</em> are machines that can store data and carry out mathematical operations on that data. For instance, a computer could store a number and then add or multiply that number by another number. A computer program is a predetermined list of operations that the computer carries out on the data it has stored. Some early computers were mechanical and could only do one sort of calculation since their “program” was as result of the way their gears and levers were arranged and those were difficult to change. In 1822, Charles Babbage envisioned one of those single purpose mechanical computers that could calculate the values of polynomial equations. It proved too expensive to build (until 100 years after his death) but he continued to develop his ideas. In the mid-1800’s Babbage worked on a design he called the <a href="https://youtu.be/_fyUtU6LVNY" target="_blank"><em>Analytical Engine</em></a> which could be programmed to carry out many different kinds of equations using punched cards. The Analytical Engine was also too expensive to build but there is a <a href="http://plan28.org/" target="_blank"><em>project</em></a> underway to raise the funds and construct one by 2021. While neither of Babbage’s most famous computers were built, he is still considered a father of modern computing machines.</p><p>Even though Babbage’s machines were mechanical and had no electronic components of any sort, they were digital, in that all of their output and internal processes were reduced to integers (digits). Babbage’s machines were also decimal, in that they used the digits 0 through 9. But the next major advance in computing came in the 1930’s when researchers at Bell laboratories began working with switches and showed how they could also be used to create simple computing devices. Switches are either on or off and so it was natural to use just the <em>binary</em> digits (0 and 1) rather than all the decimal digits (0 through 9) in computers based on switches. Because these switches were electrical, binary and digital, the terms binary and digital often have an association with electrical systems in people’s minds, but they are technically not connected. Eventually transistors were invented in the 1940’s. Transistors are electronic switches based on the electrical properties of substances called semiconductors. They can be made exceedingly small and they can switch very quickly since they have no moving parts. At a basic level, modern computers are massive collections of transistors. By thoughtfully arranging collections of these tiny switches, we can create single purpose calculators as well as logical systems that can make decisions. By adding memory capacity we allow for the creation of general purpose programmable computers. While modern computers are electronic and based on binary switching, the logical basis of computing was developed long before these technologies existed.</p><p>In modern computers, both data and programs are stored in a <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/binary" target="_blank">binary</a> form which we would represent with 1’s and 0’s, but which actually take some other physical form: They may be microscopic patches of iron that are either magnetized or not magnetized on a hard drive, or in the case of a <a href="http://www.explainthatstuff.com/cdplayers.html" target="_blank">DVD, </a><a href="http://www.explainthatstuff.com/cdplayers.html" target="_blank">they</a><a href="http://www.explainthatstuff.com/cdplayers.html" target="_blank"> would consist of either microscopic pits or a flat areas</a>, or we could use transistor switches that stay either off or on, in the case of USB drives and flash memory. There are many ways to physically represent 1’s and 0’s but in modern computers, the physical representation is always vanishingly small.</p><blockquote>
<p>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.</p>
<p><em>–Arthur C. Clarke</em></p>
</blockquote><p>When the computer is carrying out its instructions, the 1’s and 0’s take the form of high and low voltages or <a href="http://www.explainthatstuff.com/howtransistorswork.html" target="_blank">tiny switches (transistors)</a> that are either on or off. Since our computers are only binary, there are always just two options: 1 or 0, on or off, high or low.</p><p>Just because we only use two digits (or states) does not me we can only count to 1, just like having 10 digits doesn’t mean we can only count to 9. We can proceed the same way in binary: 0, 1, 10 (two), 11 (three), 100 (four), 101 (five), 110 (six), 111 (seven), 1000 (eight), etc. Notice that each new place value is a power of 2: 2<sup>0</sup> = 1, 2<sup>1</sup> = 2, 2<sup>2</sup> = 4, 2<sup>3</sup> = 8, etc. Not only can represent any number in binary, we can assign numbers to letters and represent any word or nearly anything you can think of just using strings of 1’s and 0’s.</p><p>There are 10 types of people in the world: those who understand binary and those who don’t.</p><p><img src="https://lyndenmath.org/CSAssets/digitalface.png" alt="Binary Face"></p><h3 id="Languages"><a class="anchor hidden-xs" href="#Languages" title="Languages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Languages</h3><p>But humans can’t easily read microscopic magnets or invisibly small pits so instead we use the symbols 1 and 0 to represent the two binary states that the physical material is taking. Already by using 1’s and 0’s we are symbolizing reality to make it more practical for us to work with. Symbolic representations of reality form the basis of all languages. The symbols d-o-g represent a furry four-legged animal, but they aren’t the actual animal. When we talk about 1’s and 0’s in computers, it is good to remember that those are just symbols for something else. There aren’t actually little 1’s and 0’s floating around.</p><p>Even though all of our computers store data and programs in a binary form which we symbolize as 1’s and 0’s, even the 1’s and 0’s are too hard for us to work with. Instead we associate the strings of 1’s and 0’s with letters and words that represent the information in a form more familiar to us. For instance the string <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII" target="_blank">01001110 is the binary form of </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII" target="_blank">our</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII" target="_blank"> letter N</a>. It’s up to people to decide how to associate the binary form of the computer instructions with the a more humanly readable form. Many ways of doing this have been worked out and they are called computer languages, or programming languages. And just like with human languages, there are similarities and differences between the different programming languages, but because of the similarities, if you know one programming language, you have a big head start learning another.</p><h3 id="Computer-Programming"><a class="anchor hidden-xs" href="#Computer-Programming" title="Computer-Programming"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Computer Programming</h3><p>Programming a computer consists of writing a series of instructions that a computer will obey. This set of instructions is called a <em>program</em>. Computers generally have a prefered language for their programs, but we can often use translators that allow us to use whatever computer language we choose. Actually computers don’t understand the programming languages that we use at all, instead, whatever we write in a programming language is converted into binary form consisting of long strings of 1’s and 0’s and that is the form the computer actually deals with. There are different ways to do this conversion, some languages use a process known as compilation other use something called interpretation, but either way, the language that we can understand is converted into something binary that the computer can understand.</p><h3 id="JavaScript"><a class="anchor hidden-xs" href="#JavaScript" title="JavaScript"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>JavaScript</h3><p>The programming language that we will use in this course is called JavaScript. It is considered to be a fairly easy language to learn, it is understood at some level by most general purpose computers and is also useful in programming microcontrollers, making web pages do useful things, and for automating tasks in other applications like Photoshop and Office. More recently JavaScript is being used to develop native applications such as the code editor you will be using in this course. The demand for JavaScript programmers is growing.</p><p><img src="https://lyndenmath.org/CSAssets/dilbert1.png" alt="Dilbert - Scott Adams - Universal Features Syndicate, Inc. 1992" title="Dilbert - Scott Adams - Universal Features Syndicate, Inc. 1992"></p><h3 id="Section-1A-Questions"><a class="anchor hidden-xs" href="#Section-1A-Questions" title="Section-1A-Questions"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Section 1.A Questions</h3><ol>

<p><strong>TARGET</strong>: Be able to use the Web IDE (WIDE) and Pico to write and run simple JavaScript programs.</p>
</blockquote><h3 id="Preliminaries"><a class="anchor hidden-xs" href="#Preliminaries" title="Preliminaries"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Preliminaries</h3><p>So how do you write a program? First, you pick a language - in our case, JavaScript. Second, you need a way to type out the instructions. A simple word processor like NotePad or TextEdit would do the job, but we will use something more specific called an IDE, an Integrated Development Environment. Third, you need a way to convert those JavaScript instructions into something that your computer can understand and then feed it to the computer to carry out your instructions. Our IDE will take care of this for us as well. Fourth, we need to learn the JavaScript language, its nouns and verbs so to speak so that we can say something useful. We will get started with all those things in this chapter.</p><h3 id="The-Pico-and-the-WIDE"><a class="anchor hidden-xs" href="#The-Pico-and-the-WIDE" title="The-Pico-and-the-WIDE"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Pico and the WIDE</h3><p>We will write our first small program for a small computer, called a Pico. You will be assigned a Pico on a breadboard along with a USB cable. Connect your Pico to the USB cable and then to your laptop as demonstrated by your teacher. You should see a small red light on the Pico flash once when the connection is made. The red flash indicates that the Pico is getting power from the laptop via the USB cable.</p><blockquote>
<p>Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.</p>
<p><em>–Edsger Dijkstra</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Now start up the Espruino Web IDE (WIDE) software according to your teacher’s instructions. Click the orange Connect button <img src="https://lyndenmath.org/CSAssets/connecticon.png" alt="Connect icon"> in the upper left cornerand choose COM 5. You are now ready to send JavaScript programs to your Pico via the Web IDE (WIDE). For the most part we will type instructions/programs in the right side (white) and then use the send/upload button (the square with the up arrow inside) <img src="https://lyndenmath.org/CSAssets/sendicon.png" alt="Send icon"> to send them to the Pico for execution. You can also type instructions on the left side (black) at the &gt; prompt, one at a time. This left side is called the console. When you hit return at the end of the instruction line, the instruction will go directly to the Pico and wait for a response which it will enter right below your instruction after an equals sign (=). You can clear the left side by clicking the delete button with the X in it.</p><p>Try typing 1 + 1 in the console after the prompt (&gt;) and hit return. Try some other math with minus, times (*) and divide (/). Now try “green” + 1. Make sure you use the quotes around green. Did you correctly predict the outcome? As you can see the computer understood the plus sign to mean “string together” (<em>concatenate</em>) rather than “add” in a mathematical sense. Try other combinations of words (with and without quotes) or numbers with the + operator and then try some combinations with the asterisk * .</p><p>You may sometimes get errors, which means that your code isn’t understood. That’s OK, see if you can fix the error.</p><h3 id="Hello-World"><a class="anchor hidden-xs" href="#Hello-World" title="Hello-World"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hello World</h3><p>It is traditional for a first program to be something called the “Hello World” program. Type the following statement in the console.</p><p>“Hello” + " " + “World”;</p><p>This is a program. It doesn’t do much, but it’s a start. Please note that in this book, code examples like “green” + 1; will be set in a monospaced font similar to what is used in the WIDE. It will make the examples easier to follow and it will make it easier to copy and paste example into editors.</p><p>Also note that every statement in JavaScript must end in a semicolon. Although the JavaScript language itself is smart enough to add in missing semicolons for you when it is reading what you have written, it doesn’t always do it the way you might expect, so you need to always put semicolons at the end of each statement. Later in the course you will see that some statements may run longer than one line. The semicolon goes at the end of the entire statement.</p><blockquote>

<p><strong>Target</strong>: Be able to describe and use different value types and explain type coercion.</p>
</blockquote><h3 id="Types-of-Values-number-and-string"><a class="anchor hidden-xs" href="#Types-of-Values-number-and-string" title="Types-of-Values-number-and-string"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Types of Values: number and string</h3><p>In the previous section you saw that in JavaScript some sorts of values are treated differently than others. For instance in the situation “green” + 1; the 1 is treated differently than in the situation 2 + 1. JavaScript (or more precisely the JavaScript interpreter) will make its best guess as to what you mean. In the situation “green” + 1; it assumes that you want the 1 to be a character, not a number, since it doesn’t have any simple way of turning “green” into a number. But in the situation 2 + 1, it assumes that you want both the 2 and the 1 to be numbers, although you could force them to be understood as characters by putting quotes around them.</p><p>The issue goes back to the fact that everything a computer deals with is ultimately binary. We know that in binary, 00000001 is 1, but it can also mean “true”. How does the computer know the difference? In binary, 01000001 is 65, but it also stands for the letter ‘A’. In binary, the number 5 that we can do math with is 000000101, but the character ‘5’ is just another symbol like ‘$’, and the character ‘R’ is 00110101, which is also the number 53. This could be very confusing even for a computer. The way the computer keeps all this straight is by requiring that we tell it what type of a value something is before we ask it to do some work with it.</p><p>JavaScript understands several types of values. The first type of value is a number. You have already worked with numbers like 1, 0.3 and -47. You can use positive or negative numbers up to about 16 digits, with or without a decimal point. You can also use scientific notation: 1.23e4 means 1.23 x 10<sup>4</sup>. With numbers, you can add, subtract, multiply, and divide. You can also use parentheses and you can expect JavaScript to obey the normal order of operations from your Algebra class. There is one more operator that frequently comes in handy called the remainder operator, or <em>modulo</em> and it is represented by the % symbol. It gives the remainder after dividing the first number by the second as follows: 5%2 is 1, 8%3 is 2, etc. You should play with these in your editor to make sure you understand how they work.</p><p>The second type of value is called a <em>string</em>. A string is indicated by putting quotes around something, even a number. “Red” is a string and “2” is also a string. Almost anything can be put between quotes and JavaScript will see it as a string. You can’t do math with a string, but you can concatenate strings using the + operator as you’ve seen.</p><p>But what if you need to input a string with a quote symbol inside it like:</p><p><code>"The " symbol is a double quote."</code></p><p>JavaScript won’t like it because it doesn’t know how to interpret the three quote symbols, it is expecting only two. The way around it involves using a backslash symbol ( \ ). Notice that it is tilting the opposite direction from a division symbol ( / ). The backslash symbol inside a string alerts JavaScript and tells it that whatever comes right after it is special. So to fix the situation above we would type:</p><p><code>"The " symbol is a double quote."</code></p><p>and it would give us what we want. You should experiment in your editor to see how it works. This process of using a backslash to get out of the normal meaning of a character and into a different meaning is called escaping, or using an escape sequence.</p><h3 id="Boolean-Values"><a class="anchor hidden-xs" href="#Boolean-Values" title="Boolean-Values"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Boolean Values</h3><p>There is another type of value called a <em>Boolean</em> value. A Boolean value can be either true or false. Something like</p><p><code>3&gt;2;</code></p><p>will produce the value true and</p><p><code>3&lt;2;</code></p><p>will produce the value false. The symbols &lt; and &gt; are called <em>logical</em> or <em>binary</em> operators and they can be used with strings as well as numbers. The statement</p><p><code>"Adam" &lt; "Eve";</code></p><p>will produce the value true. Why? Experiment in your editor to see if your reasoning is correct. There are other logical operators such as &gt;= which is “greater than or equal to”, and != which is “not equal to”, and == which is “equal to”. The reason for the double equal sign will become clear in the next section. Try making some true or false statements with those operators.</p><p>There are also some operations that can be applied to the Boolean values, true and false. The operations are AND, OR and NOT and their operator symbols are &amp;&amp;, || and ! respectively. According to Boolean logic, a statement is only true if it is entirely true. For instance,</p><p><code>true &amp;&amp; true &amp;&amp; false &amp;&amp; true &amp;&amp; true;</code></p><p>would produce the value false, but</p><p><code>true &amp;&amp; true;</code></p><p>would produce the value true. Try some experiments with the other Boolean operators to make sure you understand how they work.</p><h3 id="Type-Coercion"><a class="anchor hidden-xs" href="#Type-Coercion" title="Type-Coercion"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Type Coercion</h3><p>JavaScript tries hard to make sense out of your programs, even to the point of changing the type of your values. This is called <em>type coercion</em>. For example</p><p><code>"5" -- 1;</code></p><p>produces the number 4, which is nice because that is probably what you intended anyway, but</p><p><code>"5" + 1;</code></p><p>produces the string “51”, which may or may not be what you wanted. This feature of JavaScript cuts both ways. Sometimes it helps you, but just as often it produces results that you didn’t expect or intend and it can make it difficult to find errors in your program.</p><h3 id="Section-1C-Questions"><a class="anchor hidden-xs" href="#Section-1C-Questions" title="Section-1C-Questions"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Section 1.C Questions</h3><ol>

<p><strong>Target</strong>: Be able to create proper variables and understand the necessity of input and output.</p>
</blockquote><h3 id="Making-a-Variable"><a class="anchor hidden-xs" href="#Making-a-Variable" title="Making-a-Variable"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Making a Variable</h3><p>To this point we’ve been poking around at a computer as though it is some sort of calculator with a full <a href="http://gizmodo.com/why-we-still-use-qwerty-keyboards-even-though-theyre-a-1643855077" target="_blank">QWERTY</a> keyboard and a big screen. Not too useful. In order to write useful programs, we need <strong>variables</strong>. Variables in computer programs are pretty much like variables in algebra. They “contain” values and those values can change. It is perhaps a better metaphor in computer science to say that the variable <em>points to</em> a value rather than to say it <em>contains</em> a value, but for an introductory programming course, “contains” works just fine and it keeps it consistent with your math class concept of variables.</p><p>In JavaScript programming there are a variety of ways to create variables. This is the standard way:</p><p><code>var firstNumber = 7;</code></p><p><strong>var</strong> is a <strong>reserved</strong> word that JavaScript uses to indicate that the word after it is a variable name. Don’t try to use var for anything else. It is a reserved word and JavaScript will complain if you do. The “=” puts the number 7 into the variable firstNumber. If you don’t assign a value to the variable, JavaScript will assign the value undefined. It is much better to assign an initial value because it tells us what type of variable you intend it to be and it helps us find errors as we read through the program. Let’s take it a little farther with the four line program below. Copy and paste the first 3 lines below into the right side of editor, select them all and send them to the Pico using the upload button (square box with up arrow).

Can you follow what is going on? With multiple line programs like this, we can make programs that do a bit more for us. Try making a similar 4 line program for strings using the variables firstName, lastName and fullName. Can you figure out from the variable names what the program should do?</p><p>You should always make variable names reflect their purpose, but keep in mind that they can’t start with numbers, can’t contain non-alphanumeric characters (except $ and _ ), can’t be reserved words like var, and can’t contain spaces. We can kind of get around the no spaces rule by using the “_” character or by interspersing capital letters. Both first_name and firstName are valid and slightly more readable versions of our variable firstname and yet don’t break the no spaces rule. Interspersing is the most common technique used in JavaScript programming. It is usually referred to as CamelCase.</p><p>You also now see why we use == for “equal to” instead of just a single =. The single = is an assigner, it puts a value into something, in this case a variable. You might be concerned that the assigning seems to be going the wrong direction. You might feel like we should use 7 = firstNumber to put 7 into the variable rather than the other way around, but that isn’t how it’s done, so you’ll have to get used to it. Just think of it like x = 7 in algebra, the 7 goes into the x.</p><blockquote>

We can work with strings and do some math and <strong>output</strong> results to the console, but what if we wanted our program to ask a user for something, process that information somehow, and then give the new result back to the user. We can already do output, but we need a way of getting information from the outside world into our program. We need <strong>input</strong>. Input and output are often abbreviated I/O. The Pico has many ways to get all sorts of information from the outside world. We can attache sensors of all sorts, we could even make a keyboard for it. It also has many ways to output information besides the console: it can turn lights on and off, activate speakers, turn motors off and on, etc. Try typing digitalWrite(LED1,1); in the console. But all of the input and output on the Pico requires more knowledge of the JavaScript language than we have at this point. We’ll come back to the Pico, but we need to shift to a different computer and IDE to more easily develop our understanding of the JavaScript language.</p><h3 id="Section-1D-Questions"><a class="anchor hidden-xs" href="#Section-1D-Questions" title="Section-1D-Questions"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Section 1.D Questions</h3><ol>

<span class="token keyword">var</span> nextAge <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">50</span> <span class="token operator">+</span> age<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token function">alert</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"In fifty years you'll be "</span> <span class="token operator">+</span> nextAge<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre><p>Before you run the program, try to predict what it will do.</p><p><a href="http://Repl.it" target="_blank">Repl.it</a> shows you a dialog box asking for your age. If you respond, the program will continue and tell you that in 50 years you will be nextAge. But it will say you are over 5000 years old!? What is going on here?</p><p>We have some new commands that I’m going to call <strong>methods</strong>. The <code>prompt()</code> method displays a box for the user to type something into and then takes what they type and sticks it into the variable age. The <code>alert()</code> method also displays a box with info, but doesn’t ask any questions.</p><p>So we’ve got input from <code>prompt()</code> and we’ve got output from the <code>alert()</code> and it is no longer in the console, so we’re heading toward our goal, but something is wrong with the math. We are expecting <code>50 + age</code> to be put into the variable <code>nextAge</code>, but instead we get 50xx with the xx being whatever age the user enters. The + is doing a concatenation rather than an addition, as though <code>age</code> is a string and not a number. And that is the problem. In JavaScript any input from a <code>prompt()</code> is considered to be a string. Fortunately there is a way to turn strings that look like numbers into actual numbers. It’s the <code>Number()</code> method. Its <strong>syntax</strong> or proper arrangement and usage, can be seen in the first line below and note that it <em>must</em> start with a capital N:</p><pre><code class="javascript hljs"><span class="token keyword">var</span> actualNumber <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">Number</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"10"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token keyword">var</span> finalResult <span class="token operator">=</span> actualNumber <span class="token operator">+</span> <span class="token number">5</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
finalResult<span class="token punctuation">;</span>

<span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="token number">15</span>
</code></pre><p>Here <code>Number()</code> turns the string value “10” into the number 10 that we use to do arithmetic. That will solve our programming problem.</p><p>As your programs get longer and more complex, it is a good practice to declare all your variables at the top of the program rather than along the way. We can use a single var statement with each variable separated by commas as follows:</p><pre><code class="javascript hljs"><span class="token keyword">var</span> age <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">10</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
    color <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">"green"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>
    life <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token boolean">true</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre><p>While I could have put all three lines on a single line, notice how the indenting improves readability. There are often multiple ways to do something. The goal of our various decisions is readability and error avoidance. We may not choose the most convenient way but we should always choose the most readable way. Using descriptive variable names, declaring them at the beginning of a program and assigning initial values has over decades of programming proven to be the best way to do things.</p><h3 id="Section-2A-Questions"><a class="anchor hidden-xs" href="#Section-2A-Questions" title="Section-2A-Questions"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Section 2.A Questions</h3><ol>

<p><strong>Target</strong>: Be able to use decision making logic in programs by including control statements.</p>
</blockquote><h3 id="The-If-Statement"><a class="anchor hidden-xs" href="#The-If-Statement" title="The-If-Statement"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The If Statement</h3><p>We need our program to be able to make decisions based on user input or other conditions. To accomplish this, JavaScript has reserved words like if and that allow us to build in that decision making capacity. Consider the following code:</p><pre><code class="javascript hljs"><span class="token keyword">var</span> birthYear <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">prompt</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Give year of birth"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
birthYear <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token function">Number</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>birthYear<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token keyword">var</span> age <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">2015</span> <span class="token operator">--</span> birthYear<span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token keyword">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>age <span class="token operator">&lt;</span> <span class="token number">16</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token function">alert</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"You are too young to be kissed"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token keyword">else</span> <span class="token function">alert</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"You are more than 16 years old."</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
</code></pre><p>The if statement in the fourth line sets up a decision. If (age &lt;16) is true, then the alert that immediately follow is executed. Otherwise the alert after the else statement is executed. Every if statement needs a condition inside parentheses that is either true or false. If true, the code that follows runs, if not, then it runs the else code if it is present. The else is optional. Using the if statement allows the program to do different things depending on the user input. It makes the program just a little bit intelligent.</p><p>Please note that in the first line, birthYear is a string variable, but in the second line it turns into a number variable. This is OK to do in JavaScript, because it is a <em>dynamically typed</em> language, but most other programming languages are not dynamically typed, so we will usually avoid having variables switch between different types in this course.</p><p>Also note that we only use the reserved word var when we first introduce (<em>declare</em>) a variable name, never after that.</p><p>A programmer puts two glasses on her bedside table before going to sleep. A full one, in case she gets thirsty, and an empty one, in case she doesn’t.</p><p>In <a href="http://Repl.it" target="_blank">Repl.it</a>, open a new document and paste the previous code. Use this code as a template. Make your own variations on the program that ask the user for input and respond in different ways depending on what input the user gives. Pay attention to the location of the semicolons. The program won’t work if they aren’t where they are supposed to be.</p><p>Note that <a href="http://Repl.it" target="_blank">Repl.it</a> is now making suggestion, highlighting, coloring and giving other clues about your code as you write it. Try leaving out a double quote. Does it notice?</p><h3 id="While-Statement"><a class="anchor hidden-xs" href="#While-Statement" title="While-Statement"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>While Statement</h3><p>Another way to control programs is by using a while statement. Suppose in the previous example, we were concerned that the user might not put in a reasonable year of birth. We could use a while and an if statement combination to check and repeat until the user gave a reasonable year. For example see Figure 2.2 below.</p><p><img src="https://lyndenmath.org/CSAssets/fig2.2sample.jpg" alt="Figure 2.2 Repl.it sample program" title="Figure 2.2"></p><p><em>Figure 2.2</em></p><p>Carefully type the program from Figure 2.2 into a <a href="http://Repl.it" target="_blank">Repl.it</a> window. Pay attention to the colors. If they aren’t similar to what is in the example, you’ve typed something wrong. Run the program and respond that you were born in 2016, then respond that you were born in 1776, then respond with your actual year of birth.</p><p>The first new thing you encounter in this program is the <code>while</code> loop. It is called a <em>loop</em> because it keeps looping between the curly braces { . . . } <em>while</em> its conditional statement is true. In this case, as long as the birth year the user enters is after 2015 (which is not possible) or before 1915 (which would make them over 100), the while loop will keep running. It will keep asking them what year they were born and keep converting their response to a number and putting it in the variable <code>birthYear</code>. As soon as they enter a reasonable year of birth during the last 100 years, the conditions will no longer be met and the while loop will not be executed. The program will move on to the next line which subtracts their birth year from 2015 to get their current age.</p><p>The curly braces are also new. In JavaScript if you want to group a set of statements together, you put them inside curly braces. You would typically use curly braces for <code>if</code> statements as well as shown below:</p><pre><code class="javascript hljs"><span class="token keyword">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>school <span class="token operator">==</span> <span class="token string">"lynden"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token function">alert</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Your colors are green and yellow"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
    <span class="token function">alert</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Your mascot is a lion"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre><p>Put the first { on the same line as the <code>if</code> statement as I did in this example and put the closing } on it’s own line below the <code>if</code> statement. Everything between the braces should be indented. Indenting is very important for making your code readable and for helping you avoid errors. While the code will run without the indenting, it will be unacceptable, sort of like writing a letter without punctuation. The reason that braces were not needed in Figure 2.2 is that there was only a single line of code between them. It is good practice, however, to ALWAYS use curly braces, even if you have only one line of code since you will often need to come back and add more lines in. So in this respect, Figure 2.2 is an example of what not to do.</p><p>Here’s another example of a while loop with proper curly brace placement:</p><pre><code class="javascript hljs"><span class="token keyword">var</span> counter <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">0</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token keyword">while</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>counter <span class="token operator">&lt;=</span> <span class="token number">5</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    counter <span class="token operator">=</span> counter <span class="token operator">+</span> <span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre><p>A variable called <code>counter</code> is set to 0. Then we begin a <code>while</code> loop which adds 1 to <code>counter</code> each time through the loop and outputs the value. Eventually <code>counter</code> becomes 6 at which point the loop condition is no longer true and the program is finished. If you paste this program into a webpage and run it, it doesn’t seem to do anything. That’s because there is no output. There is no <code>alert()</code> for instance. If you want to see the program as it is progressing, you’ll need to change it a bit. Insert this line of code into the <code>while</code> loop above <code>counter = counter + 1</code>:</p><p><code>console.log("Counter = "+counter);</code></p><p>What this <code>console.log()</code> method does is to send the value of <code>counter</code> to the console, which means we have now designated a place for the output to go. You should see the numbers 0 thru 5 printed out for each time the program went through the <code>while</code> loop. When you want to see what is going on in a program as it progresses, the <code>console.log()</code> method is very useful.</p><p>Finally, it should be noted that if the condition of the <code>while</code> is never false, the loop will never stop. For instance in our example, if we had mistakenly written:</p><p><code>counter = counter - 1;</code></p><p>then <code>counter</code> would always be less than or equal to 5 and always true, so the loop would never end. This is called an <em>infinite loop</em>. Everybody writes one by accident sometime, but they should be avoided. If you create an infinite loop in <a href="http://Repl.it" target="_blank">Repl.it</a>, you may be able break it by clicking the <strong><strong>stop</strong></strong> button, but more likely you will need to refresh the page, in which case you will lose your changes since the last save, so save often.</p><h3 id="For-Loop"><a class="anchor hidden-xs" href="#For-Loop" title="For-Loop"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>For Loop</h3><p>The next kind of control statement we will consider is the for loop. The for loop is a convenient way to do what we did with the previous while loop: repeat the loop with a counter determining the number of times we do it. The syntax of the for loop is as follows, according to the Mozilla Developer Network:</p><pre><code>for ([initialization]; [condition]; [final-expression]) statement
</code></pre><p>Rather than give you a specific example of code, they’ve given you a general statement. As you learn to program, you’ll frequently be looking up how different commands work so you’ll need to get used to these general statements. But they also give you an explanation of terms and at least one example:</p><ul>
<li>The <em>initialization</em> is where we set our counter to its starting value. -   The <em>condition</em> is where we put a conditional statement that needs to stay true for as long is we want to loop to run. -   The <em>final-expression</em> is where we add whatever we want to the counter each time the loop is completed. -   The <em>statement</em> is any single statement or set of statements { . . . } to be carried out during each loop.</li>
</ul><pre><code class="javascript hljs"><span class="token keyword">for</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token keyword">var</span> i <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">0</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span> i <span class="token operator">&lt;</span> <span class="token number">9</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span> i<span class="token operator">++</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>

    <span class="token comment">// more statements</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre><p>There are some new things here. Their counter is the variable i, which is a common variable name for a counter. i is short for <em>iterate</em> which means to change repeatedly. It starts out at zero and the loop will run so long as i is less than 9. Then comes i++? The <em>++</em> is called the increment operator and its effect is to add one to whatever variable it comes after, so it has the same effect as i = i + 1; This operator was developed around 1969 and is found in most computer languages related to the programming language C, like JavaScript. While we’re on the topic, there is another short way of incrementing a counter:</p><p><code>counter += 1;</code></p><p>This statement also does the same thing as <code>counter = counter + 1;</code> and <code>counter ++;</code> The reason for these shortcuts is that incrementing counters is a common programming task. Note that statements like <code>i++</code> are falling out of favor and your code would be considered higher quality if you used the preferred <code>i += 1</code> form.</p><p>Now back to the example from Mozilla. The final surprise is the third line:</p><p><code>//more statements</code></p><p>The two forward slashes tell the computer to ignore anything else on that line. These lines are for human eyes only. We call them comments and we will spend more time on comments in the next section.</p><p><img src="https://lyndenmath.org/CSAssets/nicetry.jpg" alt="FoxTrot - Bill Amend -- Universal Press Syndicate" title="Fox Trot comic"></p><p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript" target="_blank">Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)</a> is a great source of information about JavaScript.

</code></pre><p>Paste it into a webpage script. See if you can predict how it will work before you run it and then run it to see if you were right. Now put a couple of forward slashes // before each of the break commands. This will turn those lines into comments which the computer will ignore and it is a quick way to turn a line off and on without retyping the whole line. Now run it with the breaks commented out. You should now be able to describe what break does. Why don’t we need a break in the default section? Always make sure you include a default case to handle unexpected situations without crashing your program.

But as our programs get more complex, grasping what the program is doing and how it works can be difficult to see. Even if you are the one who writes a program, if you return to look at it 6 months later, you might forget how it worked. It would be helpful if we had some explanatory information along with the program so that if we later need to make modifications we will be less likely to mess up something important. This is what we use comments for. Here’s an example program that we will put comments into:</p><pre><code class="javascript hljs"><span class="token comment">/* CS1 - 2.B.1 - Jeff Seely - 9/28/15 3 digit

Without the heading comment (and line 3 of the program), it would be very hard to know what this program was about. While the /* . . . */ style comments can be used anywhere in a program, more commonly you will use the single line comments that you have already seen, where the comment line simply starts with //.

</code></pre><p>Clearly this commented version takes up more room and takes longer to write, but it contains useful information that helps the reader figure out what’s going on. Even the addition of unnecessary parentheses in the lines calculating <code>possible</code> and <code>cubedNum</code> can make it easier for the reader to follow. But even though it takes up more space, the computer is ignoring all the extra and so the program runs just as quickly.</p><p>What do you mean it needs comments!? If it was hard to write, it should be hard to understand. Why do you think we call it code???</p><p>Another thing that you can do in comments is say where you got code from if you didn’t write it from scratch. It is very common for programmers to copy and paste bits of code and one of the reasons this text is in digital format is so that you can easily do that. Trivial bits of code, say two or three lines, need not be attributed to a source, but if problems are solved and coded by someone else, you can’t just copy and paste the code and call it yours. There are many law suits currently in the courts between software companies on specifically this matter. Plagiarism in programming languages is still plagiarism, and in most cases you can’t use significant pieces of someone else’s code without their permission even if you do credit them in your comments. In this course, if someone comes up with a nifty chunk of code that we want to make available to the class, we’ll discuss it in class and agree to comment it if we use it. Otherwise, your code should be your own.</p><h3 id="Nested-Loops"><a class="anchor hidden-xs" href="#Nested-Loops" title="Nested-Loops"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Nested Loops</h3><p>The Armstrong number program uses what is called <strong>nested</strong> for loops, that is, a for loop inside of another for loop.

<p>JavaScript has very few mathematical operators. It has no power operator (^), no factorial operator (!) and no square root (√), for instance. Write a looping program that uses the operators from section 3 to calculate the factorial of a number provided by the user. The result should be displayed in the console. Factorial, as you may remember, is calculated by multiplying together all the numbers less than or equal to the number given. For instance, 5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120.</p>

Once the function is written it can be used anywhere in the program that it is needed by just <em>calling</em> its name instead of rewriting the code every time. As with loops, we have parentheses and curly brackets.</p><pre><code class="javascript hljs"><span class="token keyword">var</span> <span class="token function-variable function">square</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">function</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>x<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>

<span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token number">144</span>
</code></pre><p>The function has been assigned to the variable square and we created (<em>declared</em>) it just like we do with variables, but instead of assigning the variable a number or string value, we assign it a function. This syntax is called a <em>function expression</em>. The function itself, in this case, has no name. It is said to be an <em>anonymous function</em>, but since we assigned it to the variable square, we can refer to the anonymous function as square. This is not the only syntax we can use to declare a function, but it is the one we will most commonly use in the first half of this book. The keyword function requires parentheses and inside the parentheses is a variable that will contain the value that the function will work on. This variable is called a <em>parameter</em>. In this case, we are going to <em>pass</em> the value 12 into our function and it will take the 12, assign it to the variable x and then multiply x by x, which in this case is 12 times 12. The keyword return determines what the value of the function will become when the function is finished. In this case, the function will become x times x or 144 which is then assigned to the variable square. Functions can contain as many statements as needed within the curly brackets. If no value is given in the return statement, or if there is no return statement, the value of the function will become undefined. At whatever point the return keyword is encountered, the function is exited, so be careful where you put return.</p><p>The following example shows how we could use our square() function multiple times in one program:</p><pre><code class="javascript hljs"><span class="token keyword">var</span> <span class="token function-variable function">square</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">function</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>x<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span> <span class="token keyword">return</span> x <span class="token operator">*</span> x<span class="token punctuation">;</span> <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

</code></pre><p>By writing our function for squaring, we can use it to calculate the area of a square and the area of a circle without rewriting the code in the function. While the amount of code in our function is trivial, the idea is easy to grasp. If we had a 30 line algorithm that we needed to use a dozen times in our program, writing a function would be very efficient.</p><p>Functions can have more than one parameter and can contain loops or any of our other programming components, but they only return one value. Next we look at a function that takes 2 parameters and calculates powers of a given base. Can you follow how it works? Remember from math class that powers are just repeated multiplication.</p><pre><code class="javascript hljs"><span class="token keyword">var</span> <span class="token function-variable function">power</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">function</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>base<span class="token punctuation">,</span> exponent<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>

</code></pre><p>Remember it is good programming practice to declare all variables at the top, and this includes at the top of a function.</p><p>Try to keep in mind that a function always equals a value, or is undefined. Since a function equals a value, a function can be passed into another function as a parameter, just as if it was a value, which it is.</p><h3 id="Scope-amp-Global-Variables"><a class="anchor hidden-xs" href="#Scope-amp-Global-Variables" title="Scope-amp-Global-Variables"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Scope &amp; Global Variables</h3><p>An important thing to note about functions is that whatever variables are declared using a <code>var</code> statement within the function only exist within the function. For instance in the previous example, the variable x only exists inside the <code>square()</code> function. Add the line <code>alert(x);</code> at the end of the program. While the value of x should be whatever you typed into the prompt, JavaScript tells you it is undefined. On the other hand, if you put the <code>alert(x);</code> line inside the function, it gives you the information you expect. Why do you have to put the <code>alert(x)</code> before the <code>return</code>? The part of a program where a variable is available is called its <em>scope</em>. The scope of a variable declared inside a function is the function itself. It is not available outside the function. If you need multiple functions to have access to a single variable you can pass that variable around as a parameter. This is the preferred strategy, however sometimes it is simpler just to declare the variable outside of all of the functions. These sorts of variables that are available to all the functions are called <em>global</em> variables. It is common to put the names of these global variables in all caps. We will make use of global variables later when we do some simple animations.</p><p>Using global variables is considered something to be avoided, particularily if more than one programmer is involved. Programs often get changed and have bits of code added from numerous sources. You can imagine that it would be easy for different programmers to use the same variable name and if those variables are globals it would likely break the code. The way we avoid global variables is by wrapping most of our final code inside a function statement. We control the scope of our variables by wrapping them in functions. Note that it is not the curly braces that control the scope, it is the function statement itself. The curly braces inside a <code>for</code> or <code>while</code> loop do not restrict the scope of a variable declared inside them.</p><p>One final note about global variables. If you declare a variable without using <code>var</code>, that is, if you just start using a variable without formally declaring it, JavaScript makes it a global variable. This is true even inside of a function. Since this would produce very unpredictable behavior, you should ALWAYS make sure to declare variables with a <code>var</code> statement.</p><p>Another interesting property of functions is that they can call themselves. This is called <em>recursion</em>. For instance, the following function calculates the factorial of the number passed as its parameter.</p><pre><code class="javascript hljs"><span class="token keyword">var</span> <span class="token function-variable function">factorial</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">function</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>num<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>

</code></pre><p>While recursion is a useful and common technique, there are some potential memory problems with its current implementation in JavaScript so we won’t be working with it further. These problems are likely to be addressed in future versions of JavaScript.</p><h3 id="Methods"><a class="anchor hidden-xs" href="#Methods" title="Methods"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Methods</h3><p>In JavaScript, <em>methods</em> and <em>functions</em> are very similar. While they both have attached parentheses, the most apparent difference is that methods have a dot in the name as in the <code>console.log()</code> method. We have already been using several methods: <code>console.log()</code>, <code>window.alert()</code> and <code>window.prompt()</code> although the window part hasn’t been necessary for our previous uses. The words to the left of the dot give us additional information about what sort of method it is and are usually necessary for the proper function of the method. The <code>log()</code> method belongs to something called the console object and the <code>alert()</code> and <code>prompt()</code> methods belong to something called the window object. Objects will be one of the topics of Chapter 3.</p><p>There are many built in methods in JavaScript, in contrast to relatively few built in functions. Functions are mostly custom written by programmers whereas most programmers make considerable use of built in methods. In our exploration of built in methods we will begin with Math.methods.</p><h3 id="Math-Methods"><a class="anchor hidden-xs" href="#Math-Methods" title="Math-Methods"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Math Methods</h3><p>It would be a pain if we needed to create all the normal math functions like powers, roots and trig functions by writing our own functions using only arithmetic operators. Fortunately there is a nice set of math methods that we can call whenever we need them. Below is a sample of some of the most commonly used math methods. Many more are available. If you need something that isn’t listed, look it up and it will probably be there.</p><p><strong>Math.abs(x)</strong> Returns the absolute value of a number.</p><p><strong>Math.ceil(x)</strong> Returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to a number.</p><p><strong>Math.cos(x)</strong> Returns the cosine of a number.</p><p><strong>Math.floor(x)</strong> Returns the largest integer less than or equal to a number.</p><p><strong>Math.pow(x, y)</strong> Returns base to the exponent power, or xy.</p><p><strong>Math.random()</strong> Returns a pseudo-random number between 0 and 1.</p><p><strong>Math.round(x)</strong> Returns the value of a number rounded to the nearest integer.</p><p><strong>Math.sqrt(x)</strong> Returns the positive square root of a number.</p><p><strong>The Math.random()</strong> method is often used in games to simulate dice, spinners, cards or any other random element of a game. Let’s start with flipping a coin.</p><pre><code class="javascript hljs"><span class="token keyword">var</span> <span class="token function-variable function">flip</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token keyword">function</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>

</code></pre><p>Since the <code>Math.random()</code> method generates numbers between 0 and 1 and we need to split them into two equal groups, we can just check to see if they are greater or less than the half way point of 0.5. When we call the <code>flip()</code> function, coin is returned to us with a value of heads or tails. In this case, we don’t need an argument since we don’t need any information from the user for the function to work.</p><p><img src="https://lyndenmath.org/CSAssets/xkcd.png" alt="XKCD #221" title="XKCD #221"></p><p>Try out some of the other Math methods in your editor to see how they work. Make sure you capitalize the M in Math.</p><h3 id="String-Methods"><a class="anchor hidden-xs" href="#String-Methods" title="String-Methods"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>String Methods</h3><p>Another set of built in methods are available for working with strings. A sampling of some of the many methods available are listed:</p><p><strong>charAt()</strong> returns the character at a specified index. The index of the first letter is 0, the second letter is 1, etc.</p><p><strong>charCodeAt()</strong> returns the Unicode value of the character at the specified index.</p><p><strong>indexOf()</strong> returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified character, or -1 if it doesn’t occur.</p><p><strong>slice()</strong> returns a string from the first index up to but not including the second index.</p><p><strong>substr()</strong> returns the characters of a string beginning at the specified index and continuing through the specified number of characters.</p><p><strong>toUpperCase()</strong> returns the string in upper case.</p><p>Some of the methods like <code>toUpperCase()</code> have no arguments, while others like <code>charAt()</code> require one argument, and others like <code>slice()</code> require two. Next is some example code to demonstrate the syntax:</p><pre><code class="javascript hljs"><span class="token keyword">var</span> myString <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">"JavaScript"</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
console<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">log</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>myString<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">toUpperCase</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
console<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">log</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>myString<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">charAt</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">2</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
console<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">log</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>myString<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">slice</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">4</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><span class="token number">9</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

<span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token string">"JAVASCRIPT"</span>
<span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token string">"v"</span>
<span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token string">"Scrip"</span>
</code></pre><p>Try the other string methods in your editor to see how they work. You may need to look some up.</p><h3 id="Number-Methods"><a class="anchor hidden-xs" href="#Number-Methods" title="Number-Methods"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Number Methods</h3><p>In addition to the Math methods, there are also a few Number methods that take numbers as parameters and do something with them. For instance the <code>isNAN()</code> method returns true if the parameter is Not A Number. The <code>toString()</code> method turns a number into a string. You should take a look at a list of number methods so you have an idea what is available. They come in handy from time to time.</p><h3 id="String-amp-Math-Properties"><a class="anchor hidden-xs" href="#String-amp-Math-Properties" title="String-amp-Math-Properties"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>String &amp; Math Properties</h3><p>Along with methods, we have properties. Properties are different from functions and methods in that they don’t act on anything, they don’t process data, rather they simply report on something that already exists. Properties don’t have arguments. For instance we have the string property <code>.length</code> and Math properties <code>.PI</code> and <code>.E</code> with syntax as follows:</p><pre><code class="javascript hljs"><span class="token keyword">var</span> myString <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">"JavaScript"</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
console<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">log</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>myString<span class="token punctuation">.</span>length<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
console<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">log</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>Math<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token constant">PI</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
console<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">log</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>Math<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token constant">E</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

<span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token number">10</span>
<span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token number">3.141592653589793</span>
<span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token number">2.718281828459045</span>
</code></pre><p>Try to keep in mind that JavaScript is <em>case sensitive</em>, that is <code>Math.PI</code> is not the same as <code>math.pi</code>. The first way works, the second way produces an error. As we will see in the next chapter, other languages, like HTML, are not case sensitive. These differences just mean you have to pay attention.</p><blockquote>
<p>In one sense a computer is only the transistors and the connections between them, but describing it like this loses something in the process. You can’t really understand the computer unless you understand its functional relationships, what it’s trying to accomplish, and the purpose that it serves to its human creators.</p>

</blockquote><h3 id="Section-2C-Questions"><a class="anchor hidden-xs" href="#Section-2C-Questions" title="Section-2C-Questions"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Section 2.C Questions</h3><ol>
<li>Write a function that calculates the factorial of a number passed to it. Write it using the Pico and call the function with a console.log. After you have a working function, you can call it directly on the black side of the editor. Try it with several numbers. Do not use recursion in your program.</li>
<li>Using a webpage, write a function to roll 1 die that randomly returns a number between 1 and 6 to the console.</li>
<li>Use your function to write a program in which the user sees the value of each of two dice that are “rolled” in an alert() and then the program tells the user whether they win or lose. A win happens if the user rolls doubles, or some other combination that you specify. Put the rules to the game on an alert at the beginning and make sure that it isn’t too hard to win or nobody will get addicted to your game and you won’t make megabucks.</li>
<li>Add to your dice game by asking the user for their first and last names in a prompt(). Then use string methods so that your program can refer to them by either their first name or their last name in some of your output.</li>
<li>Leet originated as a letter substitution system employed by computer bulletin board users, but now in various forms it is common in all sorts of text based communication from phone texting to graffiti. A few simple examples would be to substitute @ for A, 3 for E, 6 for G, $ for S and + for T, yielding words like 6@$ and $33LY. Using at least the 5 substitutions given, make a Leet translator that prompts a user for a phrase and returns the phrase in Leet and all caps. You will need to use string methods and program control structures. A fuller implementation of a Leet translator can be found <a href="http://www.albinoblacksheep.com/text/leet" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
<li>Research the Caesar cypher and see if you can make an encoder and decoder.</li>
<li>Write a program to find and list all the 3 digit happy numbers. Note that the calculation of the 3 digit happy numbers will never require more than 3 digits. Be careful of the 0 case.</li>
